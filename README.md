# lein-otf

Leiningen plugin to produce OTF-compiled uberjars. (OTF = on-the-fly)

An uberjar's main class must be AOT-compiled for the jar to work as an
executable. Since AOT compilation is infectious (or "transitive"), most or all
of the jar is also AOT'd, along with any linked libraries. This reduces
portability.

lein-otf works by injecting a sacrificial Java loader class.  This class
inspects the JAR's manifest file for an attribute (injected when the JAR was
created) bearing the name of the `:main` namespace then calls that namespace's
`-main` (or other explicitly named) function.  Because the loader is not
statically linked against the rest of your codebase, AOT compilation is
restricted to namespaces explicitly mentioned in `:aot` (and anything they link
against, of course.)

## Usage

Compatible with projects using Clojure 1.3.0 and 1.4.0.  Requires Leiningen 2.0
or greater (including preview versions).

1. Specify the plugin as a plugin:
   `:plugins [[org.timmc/lein-otf "2.1.0"]]`
2. Take `:gen-class` out of your main namespace.  Leave project.clj's `:main`
   pointing to it, but add `^:skip-aot` metadata on the namespace symbol.
3. Run the `uberjar` task, or anything else which invokes it:
   `$ lein uberjar`

## Changelog

### v2.1.0

* Support and require Leiningen 2.0.  Switch to implementation using separated
  loader stub dependency and Leiningen 2 automatic hooks and middleware.  No
  `:hooks` entry is necessary.  Support (deprecated) `uberjar-otf` task as
  alias for `uberjar`.

### v1.1.0

* Extends support back to projects using Clojure v1.2.0.

### v1.0.0

* Provides `lein uberjar-otf` command. Works on Clojure v1.3.0.
